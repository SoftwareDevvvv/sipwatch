# SipWatch Notification System - Phase 2 Setup Complete

## ‚úÖ Completed Setup Tasks

### Platform Configuration

1. **Android Manifest** - Added notification permissions and receivers:

   - POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission
   - RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED permission
   - VIBRATE permission
   - ScheduledNotificationReceiver
   - ScheduledNotificationBootReceiver with boot completion intent filters

2. **iOS Info.plist** - Added background modes:
   - background-processing for notification handling

### Core Service Integration

1. **NotificationService** - Created comprehensive service with:

   - Initialization and permission handling
   - Daily morning tip scheduling
   - Warning notifications for water, coffee, and alcohol
   - Daily reset functionality
   - Integration with settings

2. **Main App Integration** - Added to main.dart:

   - NotificationService initialization on app startup
   - Proper GetX dependency injection

3. **DrinkEntryController Integration** - Enhanced with:

   - Notification warning checks after adding drinks
   - Automatic consumption monitoring

4. **SettingsController Integration** - Enhanced with:
   - Notification service updates when settings change
   - Reactive notification scheduling

## üìã Implementation Status

### Phase 1: Core Service Setup ‚úÖ

- NotificationService class created
- Permission handling implemented
- Basic notification scheduling setup

### Phase 2: Platform Configuration ‚úÖ

- Android manifest configured
- iOS Info.plist configured
- Service integration complete

### Phase 3: Integration (READY TO START)

- DrinkEntryController integration ‚úÖ
- SettingsController integration ‚úÖ
- Warning logic implementation ‚úÖ
- Daily reset mechanism (pending midnight timer)

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (PENDING)

- Test notification permissions
- Test all notification types
- Verify background behavior
- Test app lifecycle notifications

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Service Architecture

The NotificationService uses a singleton pattern with GetX integration:

- Automatic initialization on app start
- Reactive to settings changes
- Integrated with consumption tracking
- Platform-specific permission handling

### Warning Logic

- **Water Warning**: Triggered when exceeding water daily goal
- **Coffee Warning**: Triggered when exceeding coffee daily limit
- **Alcohol Warning**: Triggered when exceeding alcohol daily limit
- **One per day**: Each warning type shown only once per day
- **Daily Reset**: Warning flags reset at midnight

### Morning Tips

- Scheduled daily at 8:00 AM
- Rotating educational content about hydration
- Independent toggle from other notifications
- Automatically reschedules for next day

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Phase 3 Remaining Tasks:

1. Implement daily reset timer for midnight warning flag reset
2. Add notification icons to Android/iOS projects
3. Test permission flows on both platforms

### Phase 4 Testing:

1. Test on Android device with API 33+ for runtime permissions
2. Test on iOS device for proper notification delivery
3. Verify background notification scheduling
4. Test app lifecycle scenarios (app killed, background, etc.)

### User Experience Enhancements:

1. Add notification interaction handling (tap to open specific screens)
2. Add notification feedback to users when warnings are triggered
3. Implement notification history/log for debugging

## üìä Current Notification Settings Available

1. **Daily Notification** - Master toggle
2. **Morning Tips** - Educational messages at 8 AM
3. **Water Warning** - When water goal exceeded
4. **Coffee Warning** - When coffee limit exceeded
5. **Alcohol Warning** - When alcohol limit exceeded

All settings are reactive and immediately update notification scheduling when changed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. Daily reset currently happens on app restart, not at midnight
2. Notification icons use default app icon (custom icons pending)
3. No notification interaction handling yet
4. No notification history/persistence

The core notification system is now ready for testing and can be extended with additional features as needed.
