# SipWatch App - Comprehensive Testing Guide

## üö® **RECENT BUG FIX: DECIMAL CAFFEINE VALUES**

**FIXED**: Caffeine values with decimals (e.g., 25.5 mg) now save properly!

- ‚úÖ **Issue**: Decimal caffeine values (like 25.5) were getting lost when saving drinks
- ‚úÖ **Fix**: Changed caffeine field from `int` to `double` to support decimal values
- ‚úÖ **Test**: Try entering caffeine values like 25.5, 100.2, 0.5 and verify they save correctly

## üÜï **NEW FEATURE: AUTO UNIQUE FACTOR & SUFFIX ICONS**

**ADDED**: Smart unique factor selection and suffix text in Add Fluid screen!

- ‚úÖ **Auto Selection**: When drink type changes to Coffee ‚Üí Unique Factor automatically sets to "Caffeine"
- ‚úÖ **Auto Selection**: When drink type changes to Alcohol ‚Üí Unique Factor automatically sets to "Alcohol"
- ‚úÖ **Suffix Icons**: Caffeine amount field shows "mg" suffix, Alcohol shows "%" suffix
- ‚úÖ **Test**: Change drink types and verify unique factor updates automatically and suffixes appear
